%Note that sensitivity coefficients are plotted on a log scale in this figure, due to the difference 
%in magnitude between the coefficients for \( p_{m} \) and the other three variables. Here, the level 
%of uncertainty in \( E(\Delta_{m+u} ) \) is roughly 60 times more sensitive to the level of 
%uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in g-ratio, and roughly 500 times more sensitive to the level of 
%uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in length.
