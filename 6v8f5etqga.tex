\subsubsection*{\textit{G-ratio}}

Whilst g-ratios have been reported as low as 0.2 and as high as 0.8, the
remarkable consistency of this quantity around 0.6-0.7 has been the
subject of several theoretical research papers (Rushton, 1951; Chomiak
\& Hu 2009; Paus \& Toro, 2009; Caminiti et al., 2009). This parameter
was therefore assigned a modest level of uncertainty: $g$ = 0.7 $_{+/-}$
0.1. 

\subsubsection*{\textit{Proportion of myelinated vs. unmyelinated fibres}}

Uncertainty in the proportion of myelinated fibres was
also set to a modest level of $p_{m}$ = 0.8 $_{+/-}$ 0.1, which covers
the majority of conventionally cited proportions of myelinated to
unmyelinated in non-diseased brains  \cite{bowley2010age}.
