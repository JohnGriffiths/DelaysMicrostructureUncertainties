\subsection{Estimating conduction delays from microscopy and microstructure imaging data}

% - the key thing for this paper is that there is a diameter distribution and associated velocity and delay distribution 

Broadly speaking, conduction delays may be estimated from empirical data in one of four ways, 
  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct (neural or behavioural) response latency measurements such as ERPs, reaction times, or motor nerve conduction times  \cite{reed1991arm,allison1984developmental, marzi1999the,lodhia2017decreased,wishart1995interhemispheric}
\item Identification of lags, cross-correlations, MVAR model orders; or phase lags \cite{cimponeriu2004estimation,brovelli2004beta}

\item Parameter estimation from multivariate time- or frequency-domain biophysical network models \cite{friston2011dcm, kerr2011modelbased}.

\item Calculation from relevant microstructural variables (axon diameter, myelin thickness, fibre length) \cite{caminiti2009evolution,caminiti2013diameter,ringo1994time}
\end{enumerate}

Note that many techniques may fall into one or several of these categories, and will differ in multiple additional ways such as the type of delay being measured (e.g. individual cells; population average; population fastest; etc.) and how the delay is calculated and parametrized in a given model. Categories 1-3 above all operate on neurophysiological or behavioural data and rely on models of varying complexity that utilize timing relationships between measured variables, or relative to a stimulus or motor response, to identify delays. In contrast, category 4 - which shall be our focus in this paper - does not directly use any measurements of neural activity. Rather, it exploits known properties relating delays to the microstructural anatomy of axons, as well as the statistics of the axonal populations that comprise white matter fascicles in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the following we discuss the details and assumptions of this approach, first in the context of individual axons, and then our extension to populations of axons with a distribution of axonal calibers. 


It was noted as early as the 1930s that the conduction velocity $v_m$ of myelinated axons is approximately linearly related to its outer fibre diameter $F_m$ (the diameter of the outermost part of the myelin sheath), with a coefficient $c_m$ of ~0.7  \shortcite{hursh1939the,rushton1951a,waxman1972relative}. The exact value of this coefficient has been debated and revised, but the general idea has been pretty consistent for some time. Since the $F$ is a composite of two quantities (axonal diameter and myelin thickness), it is useful to decompose it into $F_m = g/d_m$. Whilst the 'g-ratio' $g$ has been reported as low as 0.2 and as high as 0.8, the remarkable consistency of this quantity around 0.6-0.7 has been the subject of several theoretical research papers 
\shortcite{rushton1951a,chomiak2009what,paus2009could,caminiti2009evolution,ritchie1982on}. Thus $v_m$ and the individual myelinated fibre conduction \textit{delay} $\delta_m$ can be computed from $d_m$, $g$, and the axonal length $l$ as follows

\begin{eqnarray}
v_m      =& g^{-1} d_m c_m \\
\delta_m =& l^{-1} v_m
\end{eqnarray}




This constitutes a simple and compact framework for calculating conduction speed and associated delays for individual axons, and has been used widely in computational and theoretical studies on a diverse range of subjects such as dynamics \shortcite{bojak2010axonal}, species differences in information processing capacity \cite{caminiti2009evolution}, and efficiency of brain organization \shortcite{chomiak2009what}. However, for the meso- and macro-scale level of neural populations that is typically of interest in neuroimaging, it is necessary to extend the single axon model of Eqs. 1-2 to  populations of axons, that may vary considerably in $d_m$ and $g$, and even $l$. 

Light and electron microscopy images of the cross-sections of nerve fascicles show that they comprise a mixture of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres of various sizes\footnote{We return to the interesting and challenging case of unmyelinated fibres later sections; for present purposes we focus on myelinated fibres only}. Critically, the profile of axon diameters, or \textit{axon diameter distribution} (ADD), varies across species \cite{caminiti2013diameter}, across brain regions within a species \cite{aboitiz1992fiber,innocenti2010fiber}, and is modified by ageing and neurodegenerative disease \shortcite{peters2009the}. Thus the ADD (together with other information such as estimates of axonal density) represents an anatomically concrete and physiologically meaningful marker of white matter status\footnote{Unlike, for example, popular diffusion MRI-based metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA)}. 

Fits to histograms of axon diameter counts indicate that myelinated fibre ADDs are well-described by a gamma distribution, with peak (mode) around 1$\mu$m and a long tail extending up to approximately 10$\mu$m. \shortcite{aboitiz1992fiber}. Several studies have used these microscopy-derived ADD histograms, together with the above equations, to obtain estimates the \textit{conduction velocity distribution} (CVD) and \textit{conduction delay distribution} (CDD) associated with a given white matter fascicle. This is done by computing Eq. 2 for all diameters within the ranges measured, and and assigning the CVD and CDD bin weightings directly from the corresponding ADD bin weightings. Whilst this approach of treating each histogram bin separately is the most empirically accurate and assumption-free way of computing CDDs (when an empirical ADD histogram is available), it is problematic when we want to know about uncertainty. This is due to the non-independence of nearby bins in the axon size count histograms. If, for example, we calculated variability (e.g. standard deviation over samples) in histogram bin weightings for different sections of the corpus callosum, and summed this uncertainty over bins, we would get a massively over-inflated estimate of the resultant total uncertainty, because adjacent bin weights will be highly correlated and therefore do not contribute independently to the overall uncertainty. 

For this reason it is preferable for present purposes to work directly with probability density functions summarizing ADD profiles, which have low degrees of freedom (generally 2 parameters), and therefore minimal redundancy. In the following we therefore represent the population of diameters within a fibre bundle by the gamma-distributed random variable $\mathbf{X_D} \sim G(x,k,\theta)$\footnote{We note that alternative and potentially superior parametric distributions have been proposed for the ADD (e.g. Sepehrband et al. \citeyearNP{sepehrband2016parametric}). Here we restrict ourselves to the gamma distribution since it has been the most widely used to date; however the majority of the following is easily adapted to alternative distribution functions. 
}, whose probability density function $G(x)$ for scale and shape parameters $\theta$ and $k$, evaluated at a given diameter $x$, is given by 


\begin{eqnarray}
G(x,k,\theta) =& \frac{\displaystyle x^{k^{-1} exp(- \frac{\displaystyle x}{ \displaystyle \theta})}}{\displaystyle \theta^{k} \Gamma(k)} 
\end{eqnarray}

where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. 

Using this representation, we can now compute the CVDs and CDDs directly for the entire distribution simultaneously, rather than from individual bins. This is essential for our application to uncertainty estimation, but may also prove useful in other contexts.


We first note the following two properties of gamma-distributed random variables: 

\begin{eqnarray}
a \mathbf{X} =& G(k,a \theta ) \\
\mathbf{X}^{-1} =& G^{-1}(k,\theta^{-1} )
\end{eqnarray}

where $G^{-1}$ is an inverse gamma distribution

\begin{eqnarray}
G^{-1}(x,k,\theta) =& \frac{\displaystyle x^{-k-1} exp(- \frac{\displaystyle \theta}{ \displaystyle k})}{\displaystyle \theta^{k} \Gamma(k)} 
\end{eqnarray}

From this is follows that the CVD $\mathbf{V_m}$ and CDD $\mathbf{\Delta_m}$ for a myelinated fibre bundle of length $L$, g-ratio $g$, and ADD scale and shape parameters $k_m$ and $\theta_{D_{m}}$, are given by 

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{V_m} =& G(k_m, \theta_{V_{m}}) \\
\mathbf{\Delta_m} =& G^{-1}(k_m, \theta_{\Delta_{m}})
\end{eqnarray}

where 

\begin{eqnarray}
\theta_{V{_m}} =& g^{-1} \theta_{D_{m}}  \\
\theta_{\Delta{_m}} =& L^{-1} \theta_{V_{m}}
\end{eqnarray}

Finally, the mean $\mu_{\Delta_m}$ (or expectation $E_{\Delta_m}$) of $\mathbf{\Delta}_m$ is given arithmetically by 

\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_{\Delta_m} =& \frac{\displaystyle k_m}{\displaystyle \theta_{\Delta_m} -1} \end{eqnarray}

and the mode $M_{\Delta_m}$ by 

\begin{eqnarray}
M_{\Delta_m} =& \frac{\displaystyle k_m}{\displaystyle \theta_{\Delta_m} +1}
\end{eqnarray}

A summary of these calculations is shown in figure 1.

%The chief motivation of the present study is the techniques developed by Assaf, Alexander, and others. In particular, AxCaliber allows estimation the ADD gamma distribution parameters. 

%In the next sections we detail our methodological approach to computing CDD uncertainties, and sensitivities for the various parameters in the above equations. 

\subsection{Present Study}

The principal aim of the present study is to examine the how estimates of various quantities relating to$\mathbf{\Delta}_m$ - chiefly $\theta_{\Delta_m}$ and $M_{\Delta_m}$, depend on uncertainty in the values of $L$,$k$, and $\theta_m$, and $g$, given the both the typical ranges of these parameters and the estimates that can potentially be obtained from noninvasive imaging. Our focus here is loosely on MR imaging in humans, but the general conclusions and techniques used may also be applied in microscopy studies (e.g. Caminiti et al. \citeyearNP{caminiti2009evolution}, Innocenti et al. \citeyearNP{innocenti2010fiber}) in both human and non-human samples. In the following sections we now describe in detail the uncertainty evaluation procedure, as well as the ranges and expected values chosen for the key parameters. 


% - lengths. a lot of work just using lengths and assuming a value for velocity. 
% - now we can estimate diameters and g-ratios. 
% - there are limitations in these measurements but in principle they can be used to make calculations of the kind done above. this is what we're concerned with here.
 
%Conduction delays play a key role in sculpting patterns of brain dynamics at the macroscopic scale (Deco et al., 2009). Until relatively recently it has been necessary for researchers looking to model these phenomena to use heuristics such as head size or population averages from post-mortem studies (Nunez \& Srinivasen 2006) to estimate the length of fibre pathways in individual subjects. Nowadays, diffusion-weighted MR tractography provides a more direct and noninvasive measure of this anatomical feature, and a number of researchers have incorporated tractography-based connection length values into their models (Izhikevich \& Edelman, 2008; Valdes-Sosa et al., 2009). Many still use non-tractography proxy methods, however, based on e.g. Euclidean distance (e.g.~Ghosh et al., 2008; Deco et al., 2009) or volumetric segmentation of T1-weighted MR images (Bojak et al., 2011). As a large proportion of this research is concerned with developing either forward (e.g. Bojak et al., 2011) or inverse (e.g. David et al. 2006; Valdes-Sosa et al. 2009) models that capture subject-specific anatomy and neural activity patterns, the relative accuracy of these various non-tractography or non-subject-specific proxy measures of fibre length is an important practical question. Similarly, a question that is certain to receive growing attention in the coming decade is how the `new breed' of MRI-based tissue microstructure metrics might contribute to this enterprise. Recent developments in structural MR imaging are making measurements of both axon diameters (Assaf et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Alexander et al., 2010), myelin thickness (Stikov et al., 2011), myelin dystrophy (Avram et al., 2010). Whether these developments play a peripheral or a central role in future models of human brain dynamics will be a function of the precision of the measurements and the degree of precision required in the modelling process.

%$\subsection{Present studies}


%The aim of the present study was to evaluate systematically the accuracy and potential sources of variability involved in both current uses of tractography and potential future uses of microstructure imaging for anatomically-informed models of neural dynamics.

% We used linear uncertainty propagation techniques to assess the extent to which accurate knowledge of fibre length, diameter distribution, and myelin thickness contribute to accurate estimates of CDDs.  For this I drew on the results from a number of histological and neuroimaging sources. 

% Tract length measures are important for models of spatially distant interacting neuronal populations that incorporate axonal conduction delays. The reason for assessing the accuracy of the various fibre length approximations described in the previous section is that this directly affects the precision of conduction delay estimates based on these measures. However, track length is not the sole source of uncertainty in these delay estimates: myelin thickness, proportion of myelinated vs.~unmyelinated fibres, and the distributions of myelinated and unmyelinated diameters are all known with varying degrees of uncertainty, and varying levels of possibly for improved measurement accuracy. I

%n order to properly quantify the contribution of uncertainties in each of these quantities to the total uncertainty in
%conduction delay estimates, I conducted a series of formal uncertainty
%evaluations, in accordance with the rules and guidelines set out by the
%Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (2008).
