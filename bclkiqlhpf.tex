\begin{eqnarray}
G(x,k,\theta) =& \frac{\displaystyle x^{k-1} exp(- \frac{\displaystyle x}{ \displaystyle \theta})}}{\displaystyle \theta^{k} \Gamma(k)} 
\end{eqnarray}

where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. 

Using this representation, we can now compute the CVDs and CDDs directly for the entire distribution simultaneously, rather than from individual bins. This is essential for our application to uncertainty estimation, but may also prove useful in other contexts.
