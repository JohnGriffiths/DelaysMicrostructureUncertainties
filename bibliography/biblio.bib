  abstract = {NERVOUS messages are invariably associated with an electrical change known as the action potential. This potential is generally believed to arise at a membrane which is situated between the axoplasm and the external medium. If this theory is correct, it should be possible to record the action potential between an electrode inside a nerve fibre and the conducting fluid outside it. Most nerve fibres are too small for this to be tested directly, but we have recently succeeded in inserting micro-electrodes into the giant axons of squids (Loligo forbesi)1.},

  abstract = {For myelinated fibers, it is experimentally well established that spike conduction velocity is proportional to fiber diameter. However no really satisfactory theoretical treatment has been proposed. To treat this problem a theoretical axon was described consisting of lengths of passive leaky cable (internode) regularly interrupted by short isopotential patches of excitable membrane (node). The nodal membrane was assumed to obey the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. The explicit diameter dependencies of the various parameters were incorporated into the equations. The fiber diameter to axon diameter ratio was taken to be constant, and the internode length was taken to be proportional to the fiber diameter. Both these conditions reflect the situation that exists in real, experimental fibers. Dimensional analysis shows that these anatomical conditions are equivalent to Rushton's (1951) assumption of corresponding states. Hence, conduction velocity will be proportional to fiber diameter, in complete agreement with the experimental findings. Digital computer solutions of these equations were made in order to compute a set of actual velocities. Computations made with constant internode length or constant myelin thickness (i.e., nonconstant fiber diameter to axon diameter ratio) did not show linearity of the velocity-diameter relation.},

  abstract = {Impulses in rat locus coeruleus neurons exhibit pronounced conduction latency decreases, followed by even larger latency increases (of over 20 msec in some cases) during a single train of antidromic activation. The magnitude of latency fluctuation varies as a function of basal antidromic latency, frequency of stimulation, and number of stimuli in a train. These and additional data indicate that this variability in latency is a consequence of altered impulse conduction velocity along the axons, perhaps reflecting reduced ion concentration gradients resulting from impulse propagation. These latency changes may allow thin unmyelinated axons to influence target cells most effectively with short bursts of activity, and suggest that myelination and large axon diameter provide for high fidelity as well as for high velocity of impulse flow in nervous tissue.},

Peak and interpeak latencies, and left-right differences in latency, were analyzed as a function of age, sex, and estimates of brain and body size. Major features of the results were: (1) Peak latencies of all components showed statistically significant increases in latency with age except that VEP P100 latency decreased significantly between 4 and 19 years and did not change between 20 and 59 years. (2) In adults the peak latencies of all components were significantly later in males than in females. For AEPs and VEPs these differences were explained by sex differences in brain size, and for adult SEPs were explained by sex differences in arm and shoulder dimensions. No significant sex differences in VEP and SEP latencies were seen in children. (3) Most interpeak latencies showed significant differences in relation to age or sex. (4) Age and sex are useful predictors of latency for nearly all peak and interpeak latencies; in addition, height is a useful predictor of SEP peak latencies. (5) Left-right latency differences showed little age-related, and no sex-related, change.The interlaboratory use of these or other normative data was discussed. It was concluded that these AEP and SEP norms can probably be used in other laboratories if stimulating and recording conditions are similar. However, VEP results are diffcult to transfer due to the poorly understood effects of variation in stimulus conditions. Some issues regarding the optimal characterization of norms were also discussed.},

They were also given the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Raven Advanced Progression Matrices. A number of multiple regression analyses show that the cognitive processing measures are significantly related to IQ scores. Other analyses indicate that this relationship cannot be attributed to the common content shared by the reaction time and the intelligence tests, nor to the fact that parts of the WAIS are timed. It is concluded that the reaction time tests measure basic cognitive operations which are involved in many forms of intellectual behavior, and that individual differences in intelligence can be attributed, to a moderate extent, to variance in the speed or efficiency with which individuals can execute these operations.},

Analysis was primarily restricted to peak and interpeak latencies; visual evoked potential amplitudes were also analyzed. Major results and conclusions are: (1) ‘Developmental’ changes (that is, decreases in latency attributable to decreased conduction time in younger subjects) were not seen in the median nerve, in brain-stem auditory pathways, or in some portions of visual cortex. Small developmental changes were seen in the somatosensory afferent pathway from the cervical spinal cord to thalamus, and large changes were seen in somatosensory and visual cortex. Cortical developmental changes appeared not to be complete until 17 years of age or later. (2) ‘Aging’ changes (that is, increases in latency attributable to increased conduction time in older subjects) were observed in the median nerve, cervical spinal cord, brain-stem auditory pathways, and somatosensory and visual cortex. (3) Visual evoked potential amplitudes tended to decrease with age, particularly during development; amplitude and latency effects were dissimilar for most components. (4) Males tended to show larger aging effects than females. (5) The results suggest that age-related changes in human sensory systems are not uniform, but rather are different in specific portions of these systems, different at particular epochs of the life span, and stronger in males than in females.},

Unaltered in the old cat motoneurons were the membrane potential, action potential amplitude, and slopes of the initial segment (IS) and soma dendritic (SD) spikes, as well as the duration and amplitude of the action potential's afterhyperpolarization. 3. In contrast, the following changes in the electrophysiological properties of lumbar motoneurons were found in the old cats: a decrease in axonal conduction velocity, a shortening of the IS-SD delay, an increase in input resistance, and a decrease in rheobase. 4. In spite of these considerable changes in motoneuron properties in the old cat, normal correlations between different electrophysiological properties were maintained. The following key relationships, among others, were the same in adult and old cat motoneurons: membrane potential polarization versus action potential amplitude, duration of the afterhyperpolarization versus motor axon conduction velocity, and rheobase versus input conductance. 5. A review of the existing literature reveals that neither chronic spinal cord section nor deafferentation (13, 21) in adult animals produce the changes observed in old cats. Thus we consider it unlikely that a loss of synaptic contacts was responsible for the modifications in electrophysiological properties observed in old cat motoneurons. 6. We conclude that during old age there are significant changes in the soma-dendritic portion of cat motoneurons, as indicated by the modifications found in input resistance, rheobase, and IS-SD delay, as well as significant changes in their axons, as indicated by a decrease in conduction velocity.},

Age comparisons revealed that, compared to young adults, the older men had reduced visual sensitivity, delayed ERP latencies, greater homogeneity of EEG activity across recording sites, more positive visual-evoked potential (VEP) amplitude-intensity (A/I) slope, and poorer performance on a battery of neurocognitive tests. The EEG and VEP A/I slope findings are believed to reflect weakened central inhibition for the older men. In general, the measures that differentiated groups on the basis of age were also sensitive to differences in aerobic fitness. Compared to low fit men, the physically active men had shorter ERP latencies, stronger central inhibition, better neurocognitive performance, and better visual sensitivity. We speculate the performance superiority of the physically active men was, at least in part, the result of more oxygen being available for cerebral metabolism.},

Three recent studies of mentally retarded patients, using similar stimulation and recording, also showed increased P100 latencies relative to controls.

Towards the posterior corpus callosum (splenium), the density of thin fibers increases again, but in the posterior pole of the callosum the density decreases locally. Large-diameter fibers show a pattern complementary to that of thin fibers, having a peak of density in the posterior midbody and a local increase of density in the posterior pole of the corpus callosum. Across subjects, the overall density of callosal fibers had no significant correlation with callosal area and an increased callosal area indicated an increased total number of fibers crossing through. Considering different fiber sizes, this was only true for small diameter fibers, whose large majority is believed to interconnect association cortex.

Comparing this latency difference in students in the first IQ quartile (mean IQ = 103.4) with that of students in the fourth quartile (M = 131.2) showed mean differences of 4.13 ms versus 3.21 ms, respectively (p = .0034, two-tailed).P22 - N19 measures time for signal transmission from the thalamus to the sensory cortex. These results agree with considerably more extensive data on visually evoked potentials showing a negative correlation between IQ and the latency for a visual stimulus of the retina to produce a signal at the visual cortex (most of this latency is between the thalamus and the cortex; Reed & Jensen, 1992). The findings here agree with the visual results and strongly suggest that the IQ-latency correlation occurs because the latency indexes cortical nerve conduction velocity, an important component of information processing speed.},

In an attempt to replicate the two studies (Vernon & Mori, 1992) finding this relationship, 38 healthy, right-handed females, aged 20 to 30 years, completed the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (Jackson, 1984), a series of reaction-time tasks and were submitted to the same NCV procedures as in Vernon and Mori (1992). Contrary to prediction, NCV did not correlate with intelligence or reaction time. A reanalysis of Vernon and Mori (1992), however, showed evidence for a possible sex difference in relation to NCV and intelligence, with a pronounced correlation between these variables being found in males but a much smaller correlation being found in females.},

(1980) and the detailed study of LaMantia and Rakic (1990a) on macaques show the average size of the myelinated callosal axons also to be less than 1 micron. In man, the average-sized myelinated fiber interconnecting the temporal lobes would have a one-way, interhemispheric delay of over 25 msec. Thus, finely detailed, time-critical neuronal computations (i.e., tasks that strain the capacity of the callosum and hence could not be handled by just the larger fibers) would be performed more quickly via shorter and faster intrahemispheric circuits. While one transit across the commissural system might yield tolerable delays, multiple passes as in a system involving setting would seem prohibitively slow. We suggest that these temporal limits will be avoided if the neural apparatus necessary to perform each high-resolution, time-critical task is gathered in one hemisphere. If the, presumably overlapping, neural assemblies needed to handle overlapping tasks are clustered together, this would lead to hemispheric specialization. The prediction follows that the large brains of mammals such as elephants and cetaceans will also manifest a high degree of hemispheric specialization.},

In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs.

Synaptic inputs activated repetitively within 20 ms before spiking of the tectal neuron become potentiated, whereas subthreshold inputs activated within 20 ms after spiking become depressed.

  abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a high-input regime in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

A total of 260 and 254 pyramidal tract neurons were recorded extracellularly in the motor cortex of adult control and aged cats, respectively. These cells were activated antidromically by electrical stimulation of the medullary pyramidal tract. Fast- and slow-conducting neurons were identified according to their axonal conduction velocity in both control and aged cats. While 51% of pyramidal tract neurons recorded in the control cats were fast conducting (conduction velocity greater than 20m/s), only 26% of pyramidal tract neurons in the aged cats were fast conducting. There was a 43% decrease in the median conduction velocity for the entire population of pyramidal tract neurons in aged cats when compared with that of pyramidal tract neurons in the control cats (P<0.001, Mann–Whitney U-test). A linear relationship between the spike duration of pyramidal tract neurons and their antidromic latency was present in both control and aged cats. However, the regression slope was significantly reduced in aged cats. This reduction was due to the appearance of a group of pyramidal tract neurons with relatively shorter spike durations but slower axonal conduction velocities in the aged cat. Sample intracellular data confirmed the above results.These observations form the basis for the following conclusions: (i) there is a decrease in median conduction velocity of pyramidal tract neurons in aged cats; (ii) the reduction in the axonal conduction velocity of pyramidal tract neurons in aged cats is due, in part, to fibers that previously belonged to the fast-conducting group and now conduct at slower velocity.},

Spiking neuron models and theories however, as well as their experimental counterparts, have generally been limited to the simulation or observation of isolated neurons, isolated spike trains, or reduced neural populations. Such theories would therefore seem inappropriate to capture the properties of a neural code relying on temporal spike patterns distributed across large neuronal populations. Here we report a range of computer simulations and theoretical considerations that were designed to explore the possibilities of one such code and its relevance for visual processing. In a unified framework where the relation between stimulus saliency and spike relative timing plays the central role, we describe how the ventral stream of the visual system could process natural input scenes and extract meaningful information, both rapidly and reliably. The first wave of spikes generated in the retina in response to a visual stimulation carries information explicitly in its spatio-temporal structure: the most salient information is represented by the first spikes over the population. This spike wave, propagating through a hierarchy of visual areas, is regenerated at each processing stage, where its temporal structure can be modified by (i) the selectivity of the cortical neurons, (ii) lateral interactions and (iii) top-down attentional influences from higher order cortical areas. The resulting model could account for the remarkable efficiency and rapidity of processing observed in the primate visual system.},

Small perturbations from steady states account for observed EEGs as functions of arousal. Evoked response potentials (ERPs), correlation, and coherence functions are also reproduced. Feedback via thalamic nuclei is critical in determining the forms of these quantities, the transition between sleep and waking, and stability against seizures. Many disorders correspond to significant changes in EEGs, which can potentially be quantified in terms of the underlying physiology using this theory. In the nonlinear regime, limit cycles are often seen, including a regime in which they have the characteristic petit mal 3 Hz spike-and-wave form.},

In the first follow-up of their study, we report on a study using similar NCV methodologies, but testing both male and female students and using more extensive measures of cognitive abilities. One-hundred eighty-six males and 201 females, aged 18–25 years, were tested in three different NCV conditions and with nine cognitive tests, including Raven Progressive Matrices as used by Reed and Jensen. None of the 27 independent correlations in either the males or in the females are significant at Bonferroni-corrected probability levels, but 25 of 27 correlations in males and 20 of 27 correlations in females have positive signs. The exact binomial probabilities for these results are 5.6×10−6 and .002, respectively. We discuss possible reasons for the differences between the results of Reed and Jensen and our results. We also find that males have four percent faster NCVs than females with each of the three test conditions, probably due to their faster increase of white matter in the brain during adolescence.},

We therefore assessed the latencies of reflexes involving one and many synapses to determine whether variations in speed of synaptic conduction are related to cognitive abilities and reaction times (RTs). NCV was estimated by measuring speed of nerve conduction in the patellar reflex arc and speed of finger withdrawal following electric shock. Speed and efficiency of neural transmission were indirectly measured via simple and choice RT tasks. Several hypothesized relationships were supported; however, the results tend to be inconsistent.

I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as “attention to memories.”},

  abstract = {Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1–100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, <0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space–time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.},

  abstract = {The corpus callosum (CC) provides the main route of communication between the 2 hemispheres of the brain. In monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans, callosal axons of distinct size interconnect functionally different cortical areas. Thinner axons in the genu and in the posterior body of the CC interconnect the prefrontal and parietal areas, respectively, and thicker axons in the midbody and in the splenium interconnect primary motor, somatosensory, and visual areas. At all locations, axon diameter, and hence its conduction velocity, increases slightly in the chimpanzee compared with the macaque because of an increased number of large axons but not between the chimpanzee and man. This, together with the longer connections in larger brains, doubles the expected conduction delays between the hemispheres, from macaque to man, and amplifies their range about 3-fold. These changes can have several consequences for cortical dynamics, particularly on the cycle of interhemispheric oscillators.},

  abstract = {The biological process underlying axonal myelination is complex and often prone to injury and disease. The ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter or g-ratio is widely utilized as a functional and structural index of optimal axonal myelination. Based on the speed of fiber conduction, Rushton was the first to derive a theoretical estimate of the optimal g-ratio of 0.6 [1]. This theoretical limit nicely explains the experimental data for myelinated axons obtained for some peripheral fibers but appears significantly lower than that found for CNS fibers. This is, however, hardly surprising given that in the CNS, axonal myelination must achieve multiple goals including reducing conduction delays, promoting conduction fidelity, lowering energy costs, and saving space. In this study we explore the notion that a balanced set-point can be achieved at a functional level as the micro-structure of individual axons becomes optimized, particularly for the central system where axons tend to be smaller and their myelin sheath thinner. We used an intuitive yet novel theoretical approach based on the fundamental biophysical properties describing axonal structure and function to show that an optimal g-ratio can be defined for the central nervous system (≈0.77). Furthermore, by reducing the influence of volume constraints on structural design by about 40%, this approach can also predict the g-ratio observed in some peripheral fibers (≈0.6). These results support the notion of optimization theory in nervous system design and construction and may also help explain why the central and peripheral systems have evolved different g-ratios as a result of volume constraints.},

AEPs were analyzed using a recently published deconvolution method and conventional component scoring. Age trends in the resultant data were determined using smooth median-based fits.ResultsComponent latencies generally decreased during development and increased during aging. Deconvolution showed the emergence of a new feature during development, corresponding to improved differentiation between standard and target tones. The latency of this feature provides similar information as the target component latencies, while its amplitude provides a marker of cognitive development.ConclusionsAge trends in component scores can be related to physiological changes in the brain. However, component scores show a high degree of redundancy, which limits their information content, and are often invalid when applied to young children. Deconvolution provides additional information on development not available through other methods.SignificanceThis is the largest study of AEP age trends to date. It provides comprehensive statistics on conventional component scores and shows that deconvolution is a simple and informative alternative.},

  abstract = {By modelling the average activity of large neuronal populations, continuum mean field models (MFMs) have become an increasingly important theoretical tool for understanding the emergent activity of cortical tissue. In order to be computationally tractable, long-range propagation of activity in MFMs is often approximated with partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PDE approximations in current use correspond to underlying axonal velocity distributions incompatible with experimental measurements. In order to rectify this deficiency, we here introduce novel propagation PDEs that give rise to smooth unimodal distributions of axonal conduction velocities. We also argue that velocities estimated from fibre diameters in slice and from latency measurements, respectively, relate quite differently to such distributions, a significant point for any phenomenological description. Our PDEs are then successfully fit to fibre diameter data from human corpus callosum and rat subcortical white matter. This allows for the first time to simulate long-range conduction in the mammalian brain with realistic, convenient PDEs. Furthermore, the obtained results suggest that the propagation of activity in rat and human differs significantly beyond mere scaling. The dynamical consequences of our new formulation are investigated in the context of a well known neural field model. On the basis of Turing instability analyses, we conclude that pattern formation is more easily initiated using our more realistic propagator. By increasing characteristic conduction velocities, a smooth transition can occur from self-sustaining bulk oscillations to travelling waves of various wavelengths, which may influence axonal growth during development. Our analytic results are also corroborated numerically using simulations on a large spatial grid. Thus we provide here a comprehensive analysis of empirically constrained activity propagation in the context of MFMs, which will allow more realistic studies of mammalian brain activity in the future.},

Searching for differences between the human brain and that of the chimpanzee, we analyzed the fiber composition in the sector of the corpus callosum containing fibers from the planum temporale. This sector was identified in chimpanzee and human myelin-stained materials by comparison with anatomical tract-tracing in the macaque monkey. The axon diameters in the planum temporale sector of the corpus callosum were not different in human and chimpanzee, suggesting that this feature of the output of the planum temporale was preserved since the common ancestor of both species and may not be uniquely related to language. However, the larger size of the human brain probably amplified slow and temporally dispersed conduction between the hemispheres. A trend with thicker axons dorsally and thinner axons ventrally in the corpus callosum was evident in human brain, but was much weaker, or absent in the chimpanzee.},

We also considered sex differences and relationships between model parameters and traditional quantitative EEG measures.ResultsThe cross-sectional data suggest that changes tend to be most rapid in childhood, generally leveling off at age 15–20 years. Most gains decrease in magnitude with age, as does power normalization. Axonal and dendritic delays decrease in childhood and then increase. Axonal delays and gains show small but significant sex differences.ConclusionsMean-field brain modeling allows interpretation of age-associated EEG trends in terms of physiological processes, including the growth and regression of white matter, influencing axonal delays, and the establishment and pruning of synaptic connections, influencing gains.SignificanceThis study demonstrates the feasibility of inverse modeling of EEG spectra as a noninvasive method for investigating large-scale corticothalamic dynamics, and provides a basis for future comparisons.},

Alpha peaks identified from multiple electrode sites were organized into clusters of similar frequencies whose sex differences and age trends were investigated.ResultsSignificant age-related trends were observed for frequency, position, and amplitude of dominant alpha peaks. Occipital sites had alpha clusters of higher average frequency, higher power, and greater presence across the scalp. Frequency and power differences were found between the sexes.ConclusionObserved increases in alpha frequency in children and decreases in the elderly were consistent with those from earlier studies. A large fraction of participants (≈44%) showed multiple distinct alpha rhythm thus investigations which only examine the alpha frequency with the highest peak power can produce misleading results. The strong dependence of alpha frequency on age and anterior–posterior position indicates use of a fixed alpha frequency band is insufficient to capture the full characteristics of the alpha rhythm.SignificanceThis study establishes alpha rhythm parameter ranges (including power and frequency) in the healthy population, and quantifies the variation in alpha frequency across the scalp. The automated characterization enables objective evaluations of alpha band activities over large samples. These findings are potentially useful in testing theories of alpha generation, where splitting of the alpha rhythm has been theoretically predicted to occur in individuals with large differences in axon length between anterior and posterior corticothalamic loops.},

The time it takes signals to travel between the thalamus and cortex decreases during development and increases during aging. Strong age trends are also seen in intracortical and thalamocortical neuronal connection strengths.ConclusionsChanges in AEP latency can be attributed to changes in the thalamocortical signal propagation time. Large changes in the connection strengths between neuronal populations occur during development, resulting in increased thalamocortical inhibition and decreased thalamocortical excitation. Standard and target parameters are similar in children but diverge during adolescence, due to changes in thalamocortical loop activity.SignificanceModel-based AEP analysis links age-related changes in brain electrophysiology to underlying changes in brain anatomy and physiology, and yields quantitative predictions of several currently unknown physiological and anatomical properties of the brain.},

We examined visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to pattern-reversal, motion-onset (translation and radial motion) and visual stimuli with a cognitive task (cognitive VEPs – P300 wave) at luminance of 17cd/m2. The most significant age-related change in a group of 150 healthy volunteers (15–85years of age) was the increase in the P300 wave latency (2ms per 1year of age). Delays of the motion-onset VEPs (0.47ms/year in translation and 0.46ms/year in radial motion) and the pattern-reversal VEPs (0.26ms/year) and the reductions of their amplitudes with increasing subject age (primarily in P300) were also found to be significant. The amplitude of the motion-onset VEPs to radial motion remained the most constant parameter with increasing age. Age-related changes were stronger in males.Our results indicate that cognitive VEPs, despite larger variability of their parameters, could be a useful criterion for an objective evaluation of the aging processes within the CNS. Possible differences in aging between the motion-processing system and the form-processing system within the visual pathway might be indicated by the more pronounced delay in the motion-onset VEPs and by their preserved size for radial motion (a biologically significant variant of motion) compared to the changes in pattern-reversal VEPs.},

We find that they also differ in the diameter of long corticofugal axons, with the thickest axons originating from primary motor, somatosensory, and visual areas and the thinnest ones from prefrontal and temporal areas. Since diameter is proportional to axonal conduction velocity, it can be inferred that action potentials issued from the different areas will be relayed to their targets at different speed. Conduction delays also depend on conduction distance. By computing conduction velocity and conduction distances, we found the longest conduction delays for the primary visual and temporal areas and the shortest for the premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory areas, compatible with the available electrophysiological data. These findings seem to establish a new principle in cortical organization relevant to the pathophysiology of neurological or psychiatric illnesses as well as to the speed of information processing in cortical circuits.},

In six macaque monkeys and three human subjects, the length of fiber tracts was obtained from histological data and combined with information on the distribution of axon diameter, so as to estimate callosal conduction delays from different areas. The results showed that in monkeys, the spectrum of tract lengths obtained with DTT closely matches that estimated from histological reconstruction of axons labeled with an anterogradely transported tracer. For each sector of the callosum, we obtained very similar conduction delays regardless of whether conduction distance was obtained from tractography or from histological analysis of labeled axons. This direct validation of DTT measurements by histological methods in monkeys was a prerequisite for the computation of the callosal conduction distances and delays in humans, which we had previously obtained by extrapolating the length of callosal axons from that of the monkey, proportionally to the brain volumes in the two species. For this analysis, we used the distribution of axon diameters from four different sectors of the corpus callosum. As in monkeys, in humans the shortest callosal conduction delays were those of motor, somatosensory, and premotor areas; the longer ones were those of temporal, parietal, and visual areas. These results provide the first histological validation of anatomical data about connection length in the primate brain based on DTT imaging.},

Numerous studies have found that the corpus callosum is structurally smaller and atypical in individuals with Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) but whether this is associated with changes in interhemispheric time transfer in adult individuals with ASD is relatively unknown.MethodThe current study used a Poffenberger paradigm in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to measure IHTT between individuals with ASD and typically developing controls. The IHTT in each direction was estimated by comparing the latencies of P100 and N170 components in hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to lateralised visual stimulation.ResultsBoth groups demonstrated faster right to left transfer of information compared to the left to right transmission. Individuals with ASD exhibited faster IHTT latencies overall for the P100 and N170 components compared to matched typically developing controls. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the ASD group exhibited faster transfer in both directions compared to matched typically developing controls.ConclusionThese findings suggest hyper-connectivity of local networks in parietal and occipital regions of the corpus callosum in ASD and may have implications in how information is integrated between hemispheres in ASD.},

  abstract = {This note describes an extension of Bayesian model inversion procedures for the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) of complex-valued data. Modeling complex data can be particularly useful in the analysis of multivariate ergodic (stationary) time-series. We illustrate this with a generalization of DCM for steady-state responses that models both the real and imaginary parts of sample cross-spectra. DCM allows one to infer underlying biophysical parameters generating data (like synaptic time constants, connection strengths and conduction delays). Because transfer functions and complex cross-spectra can be generated from these parameters, one can also describe the implicit system architecture in terms of conventional (linear systems) measures; like coherence, phase-delay or cross-correlation functions. Crucially, these measures can be derived in both sensor and source-space. In other words, one can examine the cross-correlation or phase-delay functions between hidden neuronal sources using non-invasive data and relate these functions to synaptic parameters and neuronal conduction delays. We illustrate these points using local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, with a special focus on the relationship between conduction delays and the ensuing phase relationships and cross-correlation time lags between population activities.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that synchronized beta frequency (14-30 Hz) oscillations in the primary motor cortex are involved in maintaining steady contractions of contralateral arm and hand muscles. However, little is known about the role of postcentral cortical areas in motor maintenance and their patterns of interaction with motor cortex. We investigated the functional relations of beta-synchronized neuronal assemblies in pre- and postcentral areas of two monkeys as they pressed a hand lever during the wait period of a visual discrimination task. By using power and coherence spectral analysis, we identified a beta-synchronized large-scale network linking pre- and postcentral areas. We then used Granger causality spectra to measure directional influences among recording sites. In both monkeys, strong Granger causal influences were observed from primary somatosensory cortex to both motor cortex and inferior posterior parietal cortex, with the latter area also exerting Granger causal influences on motor cortex. Granger causal influences from motor cortex to postcentral sites, however, were weak in one monkey and not observed in the other. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate in awake monkeys that synchronized beta oscillations bind multiple sensorimotor areas into a large-scale network during motor maintenance behavior and carry Granger causal influences from primary somatosensory and inferior posterior parietal cortices to motor cortex.},

The present study uses a recent stereological method that allows quantitation of the myelinated nerve fibers in the brain white matter. As especially the prefrontal region is of interest in schizophrenics, the prefrontal white matter was quantitated separately. The total length of nerve fibers in post-mortem brains was estimated from eight male chronic schizophrenics and nine male controls (age-range: 40–81 years). Samples were taken systematically and randomly from both the entire white matter and selectively from the prefrontal white matter. The biopsies were rotated randomly before sectioning to avoid bias due to the anisotropic nature of nerve fibers. The fibers were counted at light microscopic level at about 10,000× magnification and the fiber diameter of each counted fiber was measured to get the size distribution of the fibers. The schizophrenics had a total of 129,000 km myelinated fibers in the white matter and 25,700 km in the prefrontal white matter, which was non-significantly different from a total of 137,000 km in the entire white matter and 27,600 km in the prefrontal white matter in controls. The size distribution of the fibers in schizophrenics was within normal limits compared to controls. Our results do not show a larger loss of nerve fibers in neither the white matter globally or in the prefrontal white matter of schizophrenics.},

To investigate this, the total subcortical myelinated nerve fiber length was estimated in postmortem brains from eight females (age 79–88 years) with severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compared with brains from 10 female control subjects (age 74–92 years). A stereological method for estimating myelinated brain fibers includes sampling systematically, randomly from the white matter, and counting fibers in unbiased counting frames using light microscopy at approximately 6000× magnification. The diameter of each counted fiber was measured to obtain the diameter distribution of myelinated fibers in both groups.The mean total myelinated fiber length was 81,554 km in the AD group and 78,896 km in the control group (P=0.63). All other measured parameters were also unaffected in the AD brains: The mean fiber length density was 248 km/cm3 in the AD group and 247 km/cm3 in the control group; the volume of white matter was 329 cm3 (AD) and 321 cm3 (control) and the volume density of myelinated fibers to white matter tissue volume was 0.30 in AD group and 0.31 in the control group. This is the first study of subcortical brain white matter fiber length using a stereological method on postmortem brains from AD patients and control subjects.},

  abstract = {The white matter is the structure of the brain that declines most with age—almost 30%, but little is known about the age-effect on the fibers that constitute the white matter. In the present study, the total length of myelinated fibers was measured with a newly developed stereologic method. Specimens came from 36 normal Danes (18 males and 18 females) with an age ranging between 18 and 93 years. Samples were taken systematically and randomly from the white matter, and the biopsy specimens were randomly rotated before sectioning to avoid bias due to the anisotropic nature of nerve fibers. The fibers were counted at light microscopic level at approximately 10,000× magnification, and the diameter of each counted fiber was measured to get the diameter distribution. Males were found to have a total myelinated fiber length of 176,000 km at the age of 20 and 97,200 km at the age of 80, whereas the total length in females was 149,000 km at the age of 20 and 82,000 km at the age of 80. This finding corresponds to a 10% decrease per decade or a total decrease of 45% from the age of 20 to 80 years, and a sex difference of 16%. The fiber diameter distribution showed that primarily the thinner fibers were lost with a relative preservation of the thicker ones. The marked loss of myelinated nerve fibers with age could explain some of the cognitive decline seen in the elderly. J. Comp. Neurol. 462:144–152, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In the central nervous system, axons as small as 0.2 µm in diameter may be myelinated2–5. In his paper on the effects of myelin on conduction velocity, Rushton6 concluded that 1 µm is the “critical diameter” above which “myelin increases conduction velocity” and below which “conduction is faster without myelination”. This conclusion is referred to widely (see, for example, refs. 7–9). In this communication we demonstrate that the analysis leading to this conclusion is based on morphological data10 which do not apply either to central or to peripheral fibres, so that myelinated fibres considerably smaller than 1 µm might be expected to conduct more rapidly than non-myelinated fibres of similar size.},

  abstract = {The effects of aging on myelinated nerve fibers of the central nervous system are complex. Many myelinated nerve fibers in white matter degenerate and are lost, leading to some disconnections between various parts of the central nervous system. Other myelinated nerve fibers are affected differently, because only their sheaths degenerate, leaving the axons intact. Such axons are remyelinated by a series of internodes that are much shorter than the original ones and are composed of thinner sheaths. Thus the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, the oligodendrocytes, remain active during aging. Indeed, not only do these neuroglial cell remyelinate axons, with age they also continue to add lamellae to the myelin sheaths of intact nerve fibers, so that sheaths become thicker. It is presumed that the degeneration of myelin sheaths is due to the degeneration of the parent oligodendrocyte, and that the production of increased numbers of internodes as a consequence of remyelination requires additional oligodendrocytes. Whether there is a turnover of oligodendrocytes during life has not been studied in primates, but it has been established that over the life span of the monkey, there is a substantial increase in the numbers of oligodendrocytes. While the loss of some myelinated nerve fibers leads to some disconnections, the degeneration of other myelin sheaths and the subsequent remyelination of axons by shorter internodes slow down the rate conduction along nerve fibers. These changes affect the integrity and timing in neuronal circuits, and there is evidence that they contribute to cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {Aging is accompanied by deficits in cognitive function, which may be related to the vulnerability of myelinated nerve fibers to the normal process of aging. Loss of nerve fibers, together with age-related alterations in myelin sheath structure, may result in the inefficient and poorly coordinated conduction of neuronal signals. Until now, the ultrastructural analysis of cerebral white matter fiber tracts associated with frontal lobe areas critical in cognitive processing has been limited. In this study we analyzed the morphology and area number density of myelinated nerve fibers in the cingulate bundle and genu of the corpus callosum in behaviorally assessed young, middle aged, and old rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). In both structures, normal aging results in a 20% decrease in the number of myelinated nerve fibers per unit area, while remaining nerve fibers exhibit an increasing frequency of degenerative changes in their myelin sheaths throughout middle and old age. Concomitantly, myelination continues in older monkeys, suggesting ongoing, albeit inadequate, reparative processes. Despite similar patterns of degeneration in both fiber tracts, only the age-related changes in the cingulate bundle correlate with declining cognitive function, underscoring its role as a critical corticocortical pathway linking the medial prefrontal, cingulate, and parahippocampal cortices in processes of working memory, recognition memory, and other higher cognitive faculties. These results further demonstrate the important role myelinated nerve fiber degeneration plays in the pathogenesis of age-related cognitive decline. J. Comp.

  abstract = {Axon diameter is an important neuroanatomical characteristic of the nervous system that alters in the course of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Axon diameters vary, even within a fiber bundle, and are not normally distributed. An accurate distribution function is therefore beneficial, either to describe axon diameters that are obtained from a direct measurement technique (e.g., microscopy), or to infer them indirectly (e.g., using diffusion-weighted MRI). The gamma distribution is a common choice for this purpose (particularly for the inferential approach) because it resembles the distribution profile of measured axon diameters which has been consistently shown to be non-negative and right-skewed. In this study we compared a wide range of parametric probability distribution functions against empirical data obtained from electron microscopy images. We observed that the gamma distribution fails to accurately describe the main characteristics of the axon diameter distribution, such as location and scale of the mode and the profile of distribution tails. We also found that the generalized extreme value distribution consistently fitted the measured distribution better than other distribution functions. This suggests that there may be distinct subpopulations of axons in the corpus callosum, each with their own distribution profiles. In addition, we observed that several other distributions outperformed the gamma distribution, yet had the same number of unknown parameters; these were the inverse Gaussian, log normal, log logistic and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.},

The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as “attention to memories.”},
