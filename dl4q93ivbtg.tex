\subsection{Relative contributions of length, diameter, and myelin thickness to precision of conduction delay estimates}

The uncertainty evaluation technique outlined above provides a framework for assessing quantitatively and comprehensively the sensitivity to input parameters demonstrated visually and
intuitively in the previous section. 

%Figure X shows sensitivity coefficients measurement models f1 and f2. 
%Figure X shows combined standard uncertainties for measurement models f1 and f2.
% (what does this look like?)
%Sensitivity coefficients for g and theta are higher than for L. 
% have 2D plot: uncertainty in outcome as a function of uncertainty level of theta and g (assume L is fixed)
% - g vs. theta which contributes more...
