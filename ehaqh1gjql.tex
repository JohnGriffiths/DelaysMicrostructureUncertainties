$\theta_{m}$, and so in this study $\theta_{m}$ was set to lie in the middle of this range, with an uncertainty that spans the majority of this range; 3.5+/-2. Because $\theta_{m}$ and $k_{m}$ are highly correlated, the appropriate value of $k_{m}$ was selected by regressing $k_{m}$ onto the $\theta_{m}$ (figure 3, right panel), and
using the regression model to specify the corresponding $k_{m}$ for a given $\theta_{m}$. Thus, for example, $\theta_m$=3.5 specified $k_m$=4.12.
