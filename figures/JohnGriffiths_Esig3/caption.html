<div data-label="905750">Sensitivity coefficients for $E(\Delta_{m+u})$.}]Note that sensitivity coefficients are plotted on a log scale in this figure, due to the difference in magnitude between the coefficients for \( p_{m} \) and the other three variables. Here, the level of uncertainty in \( E(\Delta_{m+u} ) \) is roughly 60 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in g-ratio, and roughly 500 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in length.  is a caption</div>
