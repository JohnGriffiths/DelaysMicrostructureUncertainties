<div data-label="905750">Sensitivity coefficients for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(E(\Delta_{m+u})\)</span>. Note that sensitivity coefficients are plotted on a log scale in this figure, due to the difference in magnitude between the coefficients for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(p_m\)</span> and the other three variables. Here, the level of uncertainty in E(\Delta _{m+u})\( E(\Delta_{m+u} ) \) is roughly 60 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in g-ratio, and roughly 500 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in length.</div>
