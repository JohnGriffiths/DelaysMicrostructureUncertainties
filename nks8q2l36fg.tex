\subsection{Examples of delay distribution estimates}

The key parameters of interest in the present study are those that are actually or potentially measurable with noninvasive imaging: tract or axon length, diameter distribution, and g-ratio. 

We first present some demonstrative examples 
examples of CDDs and their arithmetic moments under variation of these parameters,
as computed from Eqs. 8-11.

\caption[\emph{Examples of conduction delay distributions}]{Show some CDDs as a function of length, g, theta. Maybe with panels, maybe on one plot. Also have a different plot showing means / modes for same variation. find extreme values. }
