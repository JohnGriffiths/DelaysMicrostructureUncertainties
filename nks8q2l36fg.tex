\subsection{Examples of delay distribution estimates}

The key parameters of interest in the present study are those that are actually or potentially measurable with noninvasive imaging: tract or axon length, diameter distribution, and g-ratio. 

We first present some demonstrative examples 
examples of CDDs and their arithmetic moments under variation of these parameters,
as computed from Eqs. 8-11.
