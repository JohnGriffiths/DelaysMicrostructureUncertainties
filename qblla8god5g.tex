Combined standard uncertainties and sensitivity coefficients the from second uncertainty evaluation for the expectation of the mixed delay distribution, $E(\Delta_{m+u})$, are shown in figures 5 and 6, respectively. In this analysis, the parameters of the unmyelinated fibre population were considered constant, and so the only parameter that differed from the results for $\theta_{\Delta_m}$ presented above was the proportion of myelinated fibres, $p_{m}$. Interestingly, it is this parameter that completely dominates both the standard uncertainty and sensitivity coefficient results for $E(\Delta_{m+u})$. The y axis in Figure 5 is plotted on a logarithmic scale due to the order of magnitude differences between the sensitivity coefficients of $p_{m}$ (105.6) and of $L$ (0.2), $\theta_{D_m}$ (0.4), and $g$ (1.8). This dominance of $p_{m}$ is also evident in the step-change in combined uncertainties (first 8 vs.  second 8 data points in Figure 6), similar to that seen for $\theta_{D_m}$ in Figure 4.
