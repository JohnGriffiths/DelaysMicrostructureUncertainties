Note that sensitivity coefficients are plotted on a log scale in this figure, due to the difference in magnitude between the coefficients for \( p_{m} \) and the other three variables. Here, the level of uncertainty in \( E(\Delta_{m+u} ) \) is roughly 60 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in g-ratio, and roughly 500 times more sensitive to the level of uncertainty in \(p_{m}\) than in length. } \label{fig:7}

Shown are combined standard uncertainties in \( E(\Delta_{m+u}) \), and in top panel of Figure 4. A step change in combined standard uncertainty is seen when 
uncertainty in the mixing proportion \( p_{m} \) is introduced.} \label{fig:6}
