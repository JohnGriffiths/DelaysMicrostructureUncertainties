%The chief motivation of the present study is the techniques developed by Assaf, Alexander, and others. In particular, AxCaliber allows estimation the ADD gamma distribution parameters. 

%In the next sections we detail our methodological approach to computing CDD uncertainties, and sensitivities for the various parameters in the above equations.
