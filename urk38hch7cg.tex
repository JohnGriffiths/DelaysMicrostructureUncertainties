In this study we have, for practical purposes, restricted our attention to non-disease questions of variability within the healthy population, and questions of measurement precision and the general relationship between delays and white matter microstructure in human and non-human brains. Naturally however, CDDs and conduction delays in general have major potential as a clinical biomarker, and to understand the implications of white matter pathology. The effect of disease-related loss of axons on the CDD depends on the whether the loss of axons is felt uniformly across the population, or whether it targets for example large fibres (ref) or small fibres (ref). If the effect is uniform, then the CDD should not change. In contrast, if there is specific loss to large fibres (above the mean; > X um), then it the effect would be to increase delay. If small, and/or unmyelinated fibres are targeted selectively, then (perhaps paradoxically) the result would be faster conduction on average. Reduction in myelin thickness would instead be expected to result in global slowing. There are multiple additional factors. However myelin thinning per se may not be a particularly common pathology. Myelin blistering, unwrapping, and then also remyelination (which also have been hypothesized to increase delays due to smaller internodes) may also have important effects on the delay structure of a given fibre bundle. The microstructure-based delay estimation framework used here would allow at least some of these various effects to be brought together (e.g. myelin and axonal changes), and also allows their importance to be assessed in relation to fibre length (slowing of long fibres is more significant than slowing of short fibres).  These changes may have influences on  neural synchrony, cognitive function, and coding.



In conclusion, we have presented an approach to characterizing and quantifying uncertainty in microstructure-based conduction delay estimates. Noninvasive microstructure imaging is a new and rapidly developing field, that has considerable potential for improving our understanding of brain dynamics in health and disease through both macroscopic and microscopic neurophysiological models. We anticipate that the future work shall build on and improve the estimates and recommendations made here, in concert with improvements in technology and understanding of brain organization in human, animal, and in-silico neural systems.

%Whilst this information has clear direct applications in models of neurodegenerative changes such as those occuring in advanced age, the primary intention of the evaluations in this chapter was to clarify what kinds of anatomical information are most useful for researchers and for the field as a whole to invest in acquiring (whether from imaging or from other sources), and to what degree of accuracy. A comprehensive assessment of this kind of question would consider many more factors and models than the simple delay distribution models described here. The approach described here could however easily be adapted, modified, or extended to address a broader set of questions. As such, it represents a generic tool for prospectively evaluating the utility of emerging imaging technologies in modelling research.



%\subsection{T1 proxy measures}



%In the comparison of non-tractography tract length estimators, a regression model based on Euclidean distances between regions was marginally superior to the more complex inverse warping approach, with prediction errors of \textasciitilde{}10mm. Note however that neither of these techniques were developed and optimized here with the full rigour of a pure methodological study, as that was not the purpose of this investigation. The aim was rather to identify the likely lower bounds on the degree of accuracy attainable without using tractography directly. The length prediction accuracy could most likely be improved considerably by both a more sophisticated predictive model and more sophisticated procedure for construction and inverse warping of atlas structures. The greatest improvements in the inverse-normalization procedure are likely to come from improved registration methods. Variants could explore different registration approaches, such as direct registration and warping of streamlines (e.g. Barrick \& Clark, 2004; Lawes et al., 2008), diffeomorphic methods, or more widely used volumetric methods (e.g. Yendiki et al., 2011; Clayden et al., 2011). The method described by Bojak et al. (2011), which identifies the shortest geodestic path betwen two ROIs within the white matter volume of a T1-weighted image, should also be considered in future comparisons. It would however be preferable to retain the methodological simplicity of the Euclidean distance regression approach, if possible. Future efforts may therefore be most efficiently spent constructing a large, high quality tractography training dataset, together with a more principled and systematic deployment of modern machine learning techniques.



%\subsection{Caveats}

%The conclusions from the uncertainty evaluation of this study must be understood with a number of caveats. Firstly, the simple phenomenological model for conduction delays ignores many of the details of real axonal conduction. The validity of a linear diameter-velocity relationship is not normally disputed however. The specific choices of the various components of the model may be more controversial. Researchers have disagreed in the past over the precise value of the constant of proportionality $c_{m}$ (see discussion in Bojak et al. \citeyearNP{bojak2010axonal}). Our choice of a gamma distribution function for the myelinated fibre diamters is not controversial, although the parametric form and moments of the unmyelinated fibre population were necessarily more speculative. Similarly, many of the uncertainties on parameter values specified in this study involved varying degrees of extrapoloation from published observations. This is particularly important, as the results of uncertainty evaluations are of course influenced considerably by the uncertainty levels specified. For example, the decision to define uncertainty levels in myelinated axon diameter distributions based on the range of values observed in figure 4.4 may be disputed. It may be preferred to instead treat these probabilities discretely, i.e. assuming that the `true' distribution for a given bundle must be one of the five, and assigning uncertainties according to relative confidences in each value. The measurement models used here may also be improved through more sophisticated specification of priors, and of the covariances between $g$, $D_{m}$, and $L$. The simplifying assumption of a single value for $L$ and $g$, as opposed to a distribution of $g$s and $L$s, could also be relaxed quite easily by increasing the uncertainty in these parameters in accordance with the dispersion of such distributions.



%\subsection{Relevance to neuroimaging}


%Previous studies have considered the computational, metabolic, and evolutionary advantages and implications of the relationship between anatomy and conduction delays. To date these studies have tended to focus on fairly gross differences between species, using ex vivo light and/or electron microscopy data, and small sample sizes. Whether the results of the present study prove useful in this line of research will depend on the tradeoff between the poorer data quality and resolution of imaging compared to microscopy on the one hand, and the benefits of being able to study individual differences and cognitive and clinical associations in humans, potentially with much larger a sample sizes, on the other.

%The groundwork of this study is important for the future work because it helps establish the current and near-future limits on the scope of tissue microstructure-based investigations into the effects of age on conduction delays. This relationship is an interesting one outright, but in the context of the present study it is developed primarily as a methodological tool for studying how disconnection-type scenarios, arising from several co-morbid forms of white matter degeneration (principally: axonal dystrophy, axonal loss, myelin dystrophy, myelin loss, shifted ratios of fast- and slow-conducting or myelinated- and unmyelinated fibres, in some as yet unknown combination), are related to the gradual cognitive decline generally seen in otherwise healthy older adults. Being able to distinguish between these various degenerative processes, and/or to quantify the incidence of each in individuals and groups of individuals, is an important basic science question that has relevance both to ageing per se and to several neurodegenerative diseases. Basic science is the focus here, however. 

%Later chapters in this thesis explore convergence between structural and functional data through the lens of dynamic connectivity and conduction delays.


%\subsection{Relevance to white matter disconnection and ageing research}


%Unlike the other chapters in this thesis, the studies described here have not been directly aimed at addressing questions relating, to $H_{wm}$, $H_{del}$, or other aspects of ageing or white matter disconnection. Rather, they provide important groundwork for the broader goal of bridging the gaps between brain structure, brain dynamics, and cognition. Precisely what level of microstructure information will be possible to obtain from new neuroimaging methods in the coming years remains unclear, and the analyses described were by design not overly specific on this matter. The general format (and code) for the uncertainty evaluations used here can, and are fully intended to be, adjusted in future studies and applied to specific use-cases and scientific questions. Certainly, in vivo structural measurements of white matter anatomy are envisaged as a key component of the new new physiologically-based disconnection framework advocated in Chapter 1, and developed in Chapter 3. As in all of science, a precise characterization of measurement and modelling uncertainties will be instrumental to progress in this area.
