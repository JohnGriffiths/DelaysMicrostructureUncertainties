For this reason it is preferable for present purposes to work directly with probability density functions summarizing ADD profiles, which have low degrees of freedom (generally 2 parameters), and therefore minimal redundancy. In the following we therefore represent the population of diameters within a fibre bundle by the gamma-distributed random variable $\mathbf{X_D} \sim G(x,k,\theta)

\footnote{We note that alternative and potentially superior parametric distributions have been proposed for the ADD (e.g. Sepehrband et al. \cite{sepehrband2016parametric}).} 

Here we restrict ourselves to the gamma distribution since it has been the most widely used to date; however the majority of the following is easily adapted to alternative distribution functions.}, whose probability density function $G(x)$ for scale and shape parameters $\theta$ and $k$, evaluated at a given diameter $x$, is given by
